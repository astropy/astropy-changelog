Format specification
--------------------

The current format uses reStructuredText. Changelog entries should be given as
bullet point items inside sections for each version. These sections should have
a title with the following syntax::

    version (release date)

The release date can be ``unreleased`` if the version is not released yet.

The version sections can optionally include sub-sections in which the bullet
items are organized, and the file can also optionally include an overall title.
